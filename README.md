# Configfiles
These scripts are use to setup my Macbook's dev env fast.

## Desc
* `macvim.sh` setup macvim with homebrew.
* `nvm.sh` setup node.js env and download v0.10 and v0.11
* `_private.sh` some priveate staff you may don't need.

## Attention
Please use this on your own risk. I only ensure that these worked on my Macbook.
